# tuki
## What is tuki?
  tuki is a static website generator that from a tile and a markdown file generates a simple static website with the posibility of adding more sections.
Currently there is only one template available but in the future I plan to expand it and make it customizable.

## Install:
  Assuming you have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed:
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/pujasku/tuki`
- Maybe you would like to change the output folder, the path is in tuki/config.json ("output_folder")
- Setup: `python setup.py sdist`
- Install: `pip install dist/tuki-0.1.tar.gz`

## Usage:
  Write tuki help for more information about the commands.
