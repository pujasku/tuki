# tuki
## What is tuki?
tuki is a static website generator that from a tile and a markdown file generates a simple static website with the posibility of adding more sections.
Currently there is only one template available but in the future I plan to expand it and make it customizable.

## Install:
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/pujasku/tuki`
- Install the dependences: `make install`
- The Makefile will sugest you to use an alias for executing tuki.

## Usage:
Write tuki help for more information about the commands.
